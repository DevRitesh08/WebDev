# **static** and **dynamic sites**

## **Static Websites**

1. **Definition**:  
   A static website consists of fixed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. These files are pre-written and delivered to users exactly as they are stored on the server.

2. **Key Features**:  
   - **Content**: Does not change unless the developer manually updates the code.  
   - **Interactivity**: Minimal or none (no user-specific data).  
   - **Backend**: No backend or database is required.  
   - **Examples**: Personal portfolios, brochure sites, or small business websites with limited interaction.  

3. **Advantages**:  
   - Faster loading times as thereâ€™s no server-side processing.  
   - Easy to host and maintain.  
   - More secure since no database or dynamic scripts are involved.  

4. **Disadvantages**:  
   - Difficult to scale for complex use cases.  
   - Updates require manual intervention by a developer.

## **Dynamic Websites**

1. **Definition**:  
   A dynamic website generates content in real-time based on user interaction or other inputs. It often uses server-side scripting and databases.

2. **Key Features**:  
   - **Content**: Changes dynamically based on user input, time, location, etc.  
   - **Interactivity**: Highly interactive (e.g., user accounts, forms, shopping carts).  
   - **Backend**: Requires a server, database, and backend programming (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js).  
   - **Examples**: Social media platforms, e-commerce websites, forums.  

3. **Advantages**:  
   - Personalization and dynamic data fetching.  
   - Easier to manage large-scale sites with frequent updates.  

4. **Disadvantages**:  
   - Slower than static sites due to server-side processing.  
   - More complex to develop and maintain.  
   - Higher security risks due to potential vulnerabilities in databases and scripts.
