## 1. Block Elements

- **Definition**: Block elements start on a new line and take up the full width available by default. They are used for structuring and organizing content.

### Common Block Elements

1. **Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)**
   - **Purpose**: Used for titles and subtitles in a document.
   - **Example**:

     ```html
     <h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
     <h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
     ```

   - **Details**: `<h1>` is the highest level, and `<h6>` is the lowest.

2. **Paragraph (`<p>`)**
   - **Purpose**: Defines blocks of text.
   - **Example**:

     ```html
     <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
     ```

3. **Division (`<div>`)**
   - **Purpose**: Groups content into sections for styling or layout.
   - **Example**:

     ```html
     <div>This is a division block.</div>
     ```

4. **Unordered List (`<ul>`)**
   - **Purpose**: Displays a list of items without a specific order.
   - **Example**:

     ```html
     <ul>
       <li>Item 1</li>
       <li>Item 2</li>
     </ul>
     ```

5. **Ordered List (`<ol>`)**
   - **Purpose**: Displays a list of items in a numbered sequence.
   - **Example**:

     ```html
     <ol>
       <li>Step 1</li>
       <li>Step 2</li>
     </ol>
     ```

6. **Horizontal Rule (`<hr>`)**
   - **Purpose**: Represents a horizontal line or thematic break.
   - **Example**:

     ```html
     <hr>
     ```

## 2. Inline Elements

- **Definition**: Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are often used for styling text or embedding other inline content.

### Common Inline Elements

1. **Bold (`<b>`)**
   - **Purpose**: Styles text in bold.
   - **Example**:

     ```html
     <b>This text is bold.</b>
     ```

2. **Italic (`<i>`)**
   - **Purpose**: Styles text in italics.
   - **Example**:

     ```html
     <i>This text is italicized.</i>
     ```

3. **Span (`<span>`)**
   - **Purpose**: An inline container for text or inline elements, often used for styling or JavaScript manipulation.
   - **Example**:

     ```html
     <span style="color: blue;">This text is blue.</span>
     ```
